==============
The new JuNet version is now available!
The major feature provided is the ability to run
a JuNest environment according to different backend programs.
The main backend remains `proot` because of its portability,
but JuNest 6.0.0 offers the execution via Linux namespaces too!

Take a look at the
[comparison table](https://github.com/fsquillace/junest#execution-modes-comparison-table)
to understand properties of each backend program.
